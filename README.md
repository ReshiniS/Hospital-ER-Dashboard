# Hospital-ER-Dashboard
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes Emergency Room (ER) patient data. The goal is to uncover insights on patient wait times, satisfaction scores, demographics, and referral trends to help hospital administrators improve operational efficiency and patient care.

# Dashboard Features
- KPI Tracking:
  - Average Wait Time
  - Average Satisfaction Score
  - Referral vs Walk-in Patients
- Patient Demographics: Age, Gender, and Race distributions
- Department Analysis: Referral patterns across specialties
- Time Trends: Yearly, Monthly, and Weekday vs Weekend patient visits
- Engagement Analysis: Administrative vs Non-Administrative appointments

# Tools & Skills Used
- Power BI – Data modeling, DAX, dashboard design, slicers & conditional formatting
- SQL & Excel – Preprocessing dataset before Power BI integration
- Data Storytelling – Turning raw patient data into healthcare insights

# Repository Contents
- Dashboard.pbix – Main Power BI dashboard (open with Power BI Desktop)
- Patient Analysis Dashboard.pdf – Exported dashboard for quick viewing
- Dashboard Power BI- img.jpg – Snapshot preview of the dashboard
- Hospital ER.csv – Patient dataset (anonymized for demo)

# Key Insights
- Patients aged 21–30 had the highest ER visits
- Referral patients experienced shorter wait times compared to walk-ins
- Satisfaction scores varied significantly across race and department referrals
- Weekend visits had slightly different patterns than weekdays

# Why This Project Matters
This project demonstrates:
- End-to-end BI development: from data cleaning → dashboard design → storytelling
- Healthcare analytics domain knowledge
- Proficiency with Microsoft Power BI (PL-300 certified)
